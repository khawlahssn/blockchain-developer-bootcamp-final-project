# A Blockchain-based E-waste Managment System

E-waste consists of electrical and electronic equipments (EEEs) that have been discarded by their owners because they're either unwanted or have reached the end of their useful life. According to the [UN](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-time-seize-opportunity-tackle-challenge-e-waste), the world produces about 50 million tonnes a year of e-waste and only 20% is formally recycled with 80% either ending up in landfill or being informally recycled. EEEs are made of components that have large amounts of heavy metals and toxic substances such as lead and mercury which is why it is so damaging to the environment and has a negative effect on human health. The cheapest recyling option for many countries is to send e-waste overseas to developing countires, hence putting the workers health at risk.

## Project Description

We'll be creating an e-waste management system on top of the Ethereum blockchain to create transparency, hold everyone accountable, and guarantee enviromentally responsible management of e-waste. 

Two main processes can occur in our system or platform:

- Purchasing:
  
1. A goverment authority (for example. ministry of climate change & environment) will be responsible for creating, running, and maintaining the network in addition to writing the smart contracts
2. Manufacturers will supply retailers with new equipment(s)
3. Consumers that will purchase the electronic equipment(s) from the retailers


- Recycling:

1. Consumer will put up their e-waste for recycling
2. Retailer will collect the consumer's e-waste, confirms the transaction, and returns it back to the manufacturer
3. Points will be added to the consumer's profile and if they recieve a x-amount of points, the GA will reward them with an NFT appreciation card for their contribution to protecting the environment
4. The manufacturer will coordinate with a waste collecter and deliever it to a recycling facility


## Disclaimer

This project idea had already been proposed, published, and implemented by a group of researchers back in 2018 so it's not entirely 'original' except for the incentive feature, also they did not provide any code so i will be starting completely from scratch.

The research paper is available on IEEEXplore, [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8554912/references#references).
