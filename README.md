# Recycling Reward System

E-waste consists of electrical and electronic equipments (EEEs) that have been discarded by their owners because they're either unwanted or have reached the end of their useful life. According to the [UN](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-time-seize-opportunity-tackle-challenge-e-waste), the world produces about 50 million tonnes a year of e-waste and only 20% is formally recycled with 80% either ending up in landfill or being informally recycled. EEEs are made of components that have large amounts of heavy metals and toxic substances such as lead and mercury which is why it is so damaging to the environment and has a negative effect on human health. The cheapest recyling option for many countries is to send e-waste overseas to developing countires, hence putting the workers health at risk.

## Project Description

The objective of the project is to incentivise people to recycle their e-waste, this can be done as follows:

1. A goverment authority (for example. ministry of climate change & environment) will be responsible for creating, running, and maintaining the network in addition to writing the smart contracts
2. Consumer will put up their e-waste for recycling which will then be collected by a waste collector
3. The waste collector delivers the items to a recycling facility which then confirms the transaction, weighs the equipments, and depending on the weight the consumer will be rewarded with an x-amount of ether. Also, they can recieve an NFT appreciation card for their contribution in protecting the environment if they for example put up over 100 items for recycling
4. The GA must approve the transfer of eth before it gets sent to the consumer's address
